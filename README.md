 **Neutralino-Phaser-Project**

 *Concept*

This game is inspired by MiniMetro
The player has a tilemap (generated), with a small city on it. As the player builds good transport infrastructure,
the city grows and surrounding cities appear. Later, there will also be maps based on real cities.
It should be more complex and have a slower pace than mini metro.
